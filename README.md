# Sonic PI, Live Music, Live Coding

This repo contains the material for the talk I gave for the 2015 Rubyday in Turin, Italy.

> Sonic PI is a free live coding synth where you can write code to compose and perform music. In this talk, I will go through the main features of the application and show how easy it is to start composing your own pieces writing plain old Ruby. Then, we will move on to the more advanced synth features, using multiple threads and sample manipulation to start producing more complex tracks. After all that, we get the party started with some live coding!
